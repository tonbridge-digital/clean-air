# Clean Air Tonbridge

Clean Air Tonbridge is a community project for measuring air quality throughout Tonbridge, Kent. We use citizen science to collect and publish realtime open data on levels of air pollution in the town.

Clean Air Tonbridge is led by the [Tonbridge Digital](https://digital.tonbridge.net/) technology group ([digital.tonbridge.net](https://digital.tonbridge.net/)). Follow us on Twitter ([@tonbridigital](https://twitter.com/tonbridigital)) or ask to join our online chat if you want to get involved.

This repository contains data and published reports from our air quality monitoring project. Please look in the `data` directory for raw CSV measurements and the `reports` directory for PDF reports.
